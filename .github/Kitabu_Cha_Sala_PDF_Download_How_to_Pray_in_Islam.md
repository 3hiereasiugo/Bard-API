- Prayer helps us remember Allah and His favors. It reminds us of our purpose in life and our dependence on Him. It also increases our love and gratitude for Him.
- Prayer helps us purify our hearts and souls. It cleanses us from the impurities of sins and worldly distractions. It also protects us from the temptations and evils of Satan.
- Prayer helps us develop good habits and qualities. It teaches us discipline, patience, humility, sincerity, concentration, and peace. It also strengthens our faith and trust in Allah.
- Prayer helps us connect with other Muslims. It fosters a sense of brotherhood and solidarity among the believers. It also promotes social harmony and justice.
- Prayer helps us attain Allah's mercy and forgiveness. It is a means of expiation and redemption; it helps erase the minor sins and mistakes we make day and night, as long as we avoid the most serious sins[^1^].

These are just some of the benefits of prayer in Islam. There are many more that we can discover and experience if we perform our prayers with sincerity, devotion, and mindfulness. Prayer is a source of guidance, comfort, and happiness for Muslims. It is a way of drawing closer to Allah and attaining His pleasure.
